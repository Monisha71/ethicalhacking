#Day 3
installation of kali linux , virtual box 
Software Required:

Oracle VirtualBox

Kali Linux ISO file

7-Zip (to extract compressed files if needed)

Installation Steps:
Install VirtualBox:

Download from official site: https://virtualbox.org

Run setup and follow the installation wizard.

Install 7-Zip:

Used to extract compressed files if Kali is downloaded as a .zip or .7z.

Download Kali Linux ISO:

Visit https://www.kali.org

Choose appropriate version (e.g., Installer ISO).

Set Up Kali on VirtualBox:

Open VirtualBox → Click New

Enter name (e.g., Kali), select Linux and version Debian (64-bit)

Assign RAM (at least 2 GB)

Create virtual hard disk (10–20 GB recommended)

Go to Settings > Storage → Add Kali ISO under Controller: IDE

Start the VM and install Kali.

Problems Faced:
No major issues during installation.

My personal issue: Thought VirtualBox was installed, but it wasn’t.

Tried to open Kali directly → It didn’t open.

Rechecked and installed VirtualBox correctly.

Had to install 7-Zip to extract the Kali image properly.
