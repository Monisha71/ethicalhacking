#Day 1
Ethical hacking (also known as penetration testing or white-hat hacking) is the practice of deliberately probing computer systems, networks, or applications for security vulnerabilities — with permission — to identify and fix potential weaknesses before malicious hackers can exploit them.

Key Points:
Purpose: To strengthen security by finding and fixing vulnerabilities.

Permission-Based: Ethical hackers always work with proper authorization.

Targets: Can include websites, apps, servers, networks, or devices.

Methods: Often use the same techniques as malicious hackers, such as scanning, social engineering, and exploitation — but with good intentions.

Reporting: Ethical hackers document their findings and suggest ways to fix the issues.

Types of Ethical Hackers:
White Hat Hackers: Professionals who use their skills ethically to improve security.

Red Teams: Groups that simulate real-world attacks to test an organization’s defenses.

Bug Bounty Hunters: Individuals who find and report bugs to companies in exchange for rewards.

Common Tools Used:
Nmap – for network scanning

Metasploit – for exploitation

Burp Suite – for web app testing

Wireshark – for packet analysis

Real-World Example:
If a company hires an ethical hacker to test their online banking system, and the hacker discovers a vulnerability that could let someone transfer money without authorization, the company can fix the issue before someone else exploits it.
